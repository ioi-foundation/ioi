# 🤖 IOI Swarm SDK (`ioi-swarm`)

**The Official Python Framework for the Internet of Intelligence (IOI) Protocol.**

`ioi-swarm` is a high-performance library for building **sovereign, autonomous agents** that run on the Internet of Intelligence. Unlike standard agent frameworks, IOI agents are cryptographically tied to **The Substrate** (Sovereign Context Substrate), ensuring that every observation, decision, and action is verifiable and tamper-proof.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Sovereign Context Substrate (SCS):** Direct integration with the IOI Substrate for intent-constrained memory and provenance proofs.
*   **Distributed Inference Mesh (DIM):** Seamlessly burst agent reasoning to a decentralized network of GPU providers.
*   **Verifiable Agency:** Every tool call generates a cryptographic receipt, providing an immutable audit trail of agent behavior.
*   **Ghost Mode:** Record agent traces locally to synthesize security policies for the IOI Semantic Firewall.
*   **Post-Quantum Secure:** Built-in support for hybrid classical/PQ cryptographic identities.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install ioi-swarm
```

*Note: Requires a running [IOI Node](https://github.com/ioi-foundation/ioi) (`ioi-local`) for full verification and settlement capabilities.*

## 🛠 Quickstart

```python
from ioi_swarm import Agent, tool, ActionTarget

# 1. Initialize your Sovereign Agent
agent = Agent(name="Autopilot", policy_id="finance-restricted")

# 2. Define a Verifiable Tool
@tool(name="get_balance", target=ActionTarget.FS_READ)
def check_vault_balance(vault_id: str):
    """Checks the balance of a specific on-chain vault."""
    # Logic intercepted by the IOI Kernel for policy enforcement
    return 100.0

# 3. Register and Run
agent.register_tool(check_vault_balance)
agent.run("Check my vault balance and alert me if it's below 50")
```

## 🧠 The Triad of Agency

IOI agents operate within a strict architectural boundary:

1.  **Drivers:** Native hardware capabilities (Eyes & Hands).
2.  **Tools:** Extensible WASM-based instruments (Utility).
3.  **Skills:** Procedural memory stored in the Substrate (Know-How).

## 🛡 Security

The `ioi-swarm` SDK is designed to be "Secure by Default." All outbound requests are gated by the **IOI Agency Firewall**, which performs real-time PII scrubbing and intent validation.
