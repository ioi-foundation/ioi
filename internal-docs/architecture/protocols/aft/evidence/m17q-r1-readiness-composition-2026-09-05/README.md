# Readiness composition design checks


### Repeated-slot readiness composition boundary (2026-09-05)

`QuvReadinessComposition.tla` checks completion schedules for a proposed rule,
not production transition refinement. Waiting a fixed bound after every member's
own head commit does not follow from the rooted active-service bounds alone:
with wait 3, fast service 1, slow service 2, and active budget 3, the fifth child
is introduced at time 16 while the slow predecessor completes at 17. Both
services are strictly within budget. The model stops before any acceptance for
that inadmissible child. Equal-service scheduling passes and a separate required
witness reaches five completed slots, preventing a vacuous always-refuse result.

A second positive configuration exempts retained-candidate preparation from the
foreground wait. It passes the same unequal-service five-slot schedule under
ideal immediate selection, no queue/competition/restart and timely complete
correct-member processing whenever the predecessor is ready. It is a design
candidate, not an implemented readiness gate or derived production bound.

The existing one-parent/child timing model assumes aggregate PreparationBound;
its pass does not derive that bound over repeated slots. Selection, fair queueing,
finite retries, durable reservation/commit and restart still need a uniform
composition bound. A per-attempt cap or readiness policy field alone is
insufficient. This witness violates the missing complete-processing premise;
it is not conflicting acceptance or an impossibility under the fixed QUV
assumptions. No timeout/silence grants authority; every relying member still
needs its own live query and non-rollback durable advance.

Evidence: `evidence/m17q-r1-readiness-composition-2026-09-05/`. The focused formal
flag `--quv-readiness-composition-only` requires two positive schedules and two
named negative/reachability witnesses; full and parent-boundary runners include
the same checks and M16Q hashes their sources. All whole R1 findings, complete
refinement, aggregate readiness and clean R2 remain open.

Initial parse failure is retained. `results.json` records the original own-wait model; exact hash-matching original sources are retained in `initial-sources/`, and generated TLC traces in `generated-traces/`. `focused-runner-result.json` binds the final split-role model and runner. No full formal collection or full R2 was run for this design check.
