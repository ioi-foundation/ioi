# Scoped candidate decoding evidence


2026-09-06 candidate decode boundary: the public effect entry uses
`decode_quv_candidate`, which checks the existing rooted 4096-byte cap before
canonical SCALE decoding. Exact-fit input parses; oversized canonical and
undecodable inputs return the capacity error; empty input retains codec refusal.
Parsing grants no authority. Removing the pre-decode guard fails the existing
mandatory capacity regression, and exact source is restored. Evidence:
`evidence/m17q-r1-candidate-decode-2026-09-06/` (one capacity regression, two
executor regressions, CLI compilation, format and syntax pass on unchanged
selected sources). The earlier pressure process predates this production change.

Proof obligation: this establishes the input-length antecedent at this decoder
entry; it does not establish SCALE heap/allocation amplification, already decoded
protobuf storage, total in-flight requests, authentication service, or the full
resource/transition refinement. Those antecedents remain OPEN under Q-A3/Q-A9.
The policy-root value is unchanged because the capacity was already rooted.
All whole findings remain OPEN; no clean R2, independent acceptance or M18Q
admission follows.

Source hashes and command results are in started.json/results.json/completed.json.
This remains selected dirty-worktree evidence, not an immutable qualified checkout.
