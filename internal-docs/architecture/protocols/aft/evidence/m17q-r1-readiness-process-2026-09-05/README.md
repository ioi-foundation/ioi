# Consecutive readiness process qualification


### Consecutive readiness qualification and consequence lock handoff (2026-09-05)

The earlier initial-slot foreground campaign passed on the preceding readiness
snapshot with unchanged recorded sources and all four evidence checks. It covered
four sole-correct placements, four saturation operations, an unrelated execution
and unchanged expired-result retrieval. The conflict pair had zero acceptances
and two typed refusals with nonmutation: safety only, not conflict progress.
That pass does not qualify the subsequent changes described here.

The effect endpoint previously held its process-wide ConsequenceStore lock across
readiness and live QUV waiting. Durable preflight now finishes and releases that
lock before waiting. The endpoint reopens the store afterward, re-derives exact
current committed admission and height, and revalidates the durable receipt.
If another request has completed meanwhile, only the existing result/reconciliation
path is used; the fresh grant does not cause a second mutation. Otherwise the
fresh process-local continuation still undergoes the immediate T10 checks. The
store remains exclusively locked across the synchronous Claim/call transition.
This change does not establish fair completion of all contenders for that lock;
StoreBusy/refusal remains a refusal, never effect progress.

The readiness clock regression now covers a second durable head transition.
Runtime diagnostics bind a positive remaining delay and observed elapsed duration
to the nonce/domain/slot before active operation startup. The new three-slot process
fixture uses a distinct rooted 40,000ms readiness profile, exact four-member live
participation, a restart before slot three, unchanged terminal parent replay, and
an unrelated effect completed on the same executor during the slot-two wait.
Each noninitial slot must have at least 15 seconds of actual remaining wait and
consume the matching fresh live audit. This is a selected finite profile, not a
replacement for existing 1,000,000ms roots or a derived aggregate QueueBound.

Core (41 pass, one ignored measurement), runtime (20 pass), endpoint lock/refusal
(2 pass), and consequence (22 pass) checks passed. Controls retaining the consequence
lock, failing to refresh the second head clock, and accepting a vacuous wait each
failed the intended regression; restored checks passed. The Rust observation
assertion includes malformed/early/wrong-nonce negatives; the retained process
checker self-test has one positive and 22 negative cases. M16Q now requires these
unit/assertion gates, the consecutive process case, and its independent host-log
checks for accepted scope, exact member coverage, wait ordering, unrelated progress
and final operation releases.

Raw evidence is in `evidence/m17q-r1-readiness-process-2026-09-05/`. The consecutive
process campaign is running; no process pass is claimed yet. Aggregate preparation,
selection/queue/scheduler/restart bounds, rooted lifetime/quotas/incremental storage,
full transition refinement, clean R2 and fresh independent review remain open.
All whole R1 findings remain OPEN. The fixed M12a/M12b, complete-correct-processing,
nonrollback retention and `portable_final_receipt=false` boundaries are unchanged.


The first consecutive campaign is terminal FAILED (exit 101, unchanged sources).
Parent, unrelated/replay-during-wait, and slot-two assertions passed; no slot-three
wait event appeared after restart. The fixture failed to observe the spawned RPC
result while waiting for diagnostics, so an early request error may have been
hidden. Recovery logged height 1 and RPC listening; this is not a proven root cause.
Raw failure and rejecting checker output remain in `consecutive-process/`.


### Consecutive readiness restart failure retained (2026-09-05)

The first three-slot campaign is FAILED (exit 101, unchanged recorded sources).
Slot one, unchanged terminal parent replay, same-executor unrelated execution
while slot two waited, and slot-two execution passed their selected assertions.
Slot two required 39.175024726s and observed 39.176213856s of waiting. The fixture
then missed the slot-three wait event after restart. Its checker rejects the
campaign; the passing prefix is not restart qualification.

The test was awaiting diagnostics while leaving an early spawned RPC result
unobserved. It now selects between the wait event and an early RPC completion,
preserving the underlying typed error. The new regression passes; restoring the
masking behavior fails within the regression's one-second observation bound.
An initial failed source-edit attempt caused a zero-test command, explicitly
retained as non-qualification; the corrected test ran and passed. M16Q requires
that regression. A diagnostic rerun of the same unchanged scenario/profile is
running under `consecutive-process-rpc-observed/`; no production cause or repair
is inferred yet. Recovery logs naming height 1 and a listening RPC endpoint are
insufficient to attribute the failure.

Both campaigns retain copies of every source named by their recorded source
hashes. The first fixture/runner versions were reconstructed by reversing the
known diagnostic edit and verified against their original SHA-256 values. This
is scoped source retention, not a full immutable repository candidate. All whole
R1 findings, aggregate bounds, full refinement, clean R2 and fresh review remain
open. Evidence: `evidence/m17q-r1-readiness-process-2026-09-05/`.


### Restart connection race identified; bounded read-only readiness probe (2026-09-05)

The diagnostic rerun failed with the explicit slot-three connection error:
`Failed to connect to public gRPC: transport error`. Its recorded sources were
unchanged. The restart helper returns after spawn; the fixture had made one RPC
connection attempt without a startup barrier. Both failed runs remain retained.

The fixture now probes the exact already-executed parent result for at most 20s
before requesting the restarted child. Only a typed ConnectionRefused cause or
Unavailable/`Node is initializing` permits another probe. Other errors and any
changed result are failures. The testing RPC connector now preserves its typed
transport cause. A real loopback refusal and the exact-result/startup classifier
pass; erasing the transport type or accepting changed result bytes fails the
regression, and restored checks pass. This is read-only startup observation, not
authority for the child: the child must still perform and consume its own fresh
live operation under the unchanged rooted 40,000ms readiness profile.

The checker now requires the recovered-parent probe and the executor's second RPC
listener between slot-two completion and slot-three waiting. Its self-test passes
one positive and 24 negatives. The initial self-test extension failed on optional
event fields in listener records; that construction error and correction are
retained. M16Q requires the new recovery regression. The corrected campaign is
running under `consecutive-process-recovery-probed/`; no pass is claimed yet.
Raw evidence and exact recorded source copies remain in
`evidence/m17q-r1-readiness-process-2026-09-05/`. All whole R1 findings, aggregate
bounds, full refinement, clean R2 and fresh review remain open.


### Three-slot readiness/restart campaign passed on its recorded snapshot (2026-09-05)

The corrected campaign passed in 295.93s with unchanged recorded sources. Its
recorded-source readiness checker and final-release analyzer both passed. All
three consecutive Fixed-domain effects executed using the relying executor's own
live operations and exactly all four configured correct-member replies. Slot two
required 39.514471166s and observed 39.515012671s before admission; after restart,
slot three required 38.648001013s and observed 38.648667936s. Their maximum valid
reply observations were 793ms and 817ms (parent: 1554ms), within the fixture's
4000ms envelope and rooted 5000ms decision interval.

The same executor returned the unchanged terminal parent result and executed an
unrelated effect while slot two waited. After restart it recovered the exact
parent result through current committed readmission before the third child query;
the checker also matched the second RPC listener between slot-two completion and
slot-three waiting. Fourteen recorded completed operations matched final-release
records (18 releases total). Maximum observed active release was 7,303,766us;
preparation maximum was 6,004,109us. These are finite host observations, not
worst-case time bounds. Neither diagnostic events nor returned parent receipt
bytes authorize a child or another executor.

The two earlier failed campaigns remain failed and retained with their exact
recorded source copies and checker refusals. This pass does not retroactively
waive them, prove full transition refinement, derive aggregate scheduling/queue/
restart costs, or close whole R1 findings. Canonical receipts, commands, toolchain,
source copies and hashes, raw component logs and checked disposition are retained
under `evidence/m17q-r1-readiness-process-2026-09-05/consecutive-process-recovery-probed/`.
The profile remains two configured domains, four correct members, a rooted 40,000ms
readiness delay and a bounded read-only startup probe. General authority lifetime,
rooted byte/rate/slot quotas, incremental authenticated storage/retention, sustained
resource qualification, complete mutation/refinement, clean full R2 and fresh
independent review remain outstanding. All whole R1 findings remain OPEN.
