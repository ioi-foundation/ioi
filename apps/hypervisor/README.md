# Hypervisor App

Hypervisor App is the native operator cockpit for IOI-governed autonomous
systems. It is a first-class client over Hypervisor Core and the IOI daemon,
not the runtime authority itself and not a single-IDE product.

The daemon owns execution, policy, approvals, model mounting, connector calls,
secrets, receipts, replay, and workspace mutation. Hypervisor App projects
state, sends typed requests, and gives the operator first-class surfaces for
Sessions, Workbench, Automations, Insights, Agents, Models, Privacy,
provider/environment views, Foundry, Authority, Receipts, and Settings.

## Working on the UX

The product UI is served as the live reference (`scripts/serve-live-reference.mjs`).
**Any UX work must follow the design system: [docs/design-system.md](docs/design-system.md)**
(see also [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and [docs/reference-api-integration.md](docs/reference-api-integration.md)).

## Architecture

```
Hypervisor App
│
├── Hypervisor shell
│   ├── Home, Sessions, Projects, and New Session
│   ├── application surfaces: Workbench, Automations, Agents, Models, Foundry
│   ├── provider/environment views: local, cloud, DePIN, storage, and nodes
│   ├── governance surfaces: Privacy, Authority, Receipts, Settings
│   └── inspectors for changes, ports/services, tasks, terminal, logs, and receipts
│
├── Code editor adapter hosts
│   ├── packaged Electron/VS Code host for the current development path
│   ├── code editor targets only
│   └── context projection and daemon-admitted launch boundary
│
└── IOI daemon
    ├── runtime authority and durable execution boundary
    ├── model artifact/catalog/backend/endpoint/route authority
    ├── workflow execution, patch apply, policy, approvals, receipts, replay
    └── connector calls, secrets, and workspace mutation
```

## Runtime Boundary

Canonical framing:

```text
IOI daemon = hypervisor/control plane for autonomous execution
Hypervisor App = native client over Hypervisor Core
Hypervisor Workbench = code/systems surface inside Hypervisor App/Web
Editor hosts = adapter targets, not product identity or runtime truth
Workers/models/tools/connectors = guest workloads/capabilities
Policy/receipts/replay = trust and audit substrate
```

Legacy native/embedded editor experiments are extraction inventory. The active
product path should not present any editor host as the parent product.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20+ LTS recommended)
- Packaged Electron/VS Code app at
  `packages/hypervisor-adapter-targets/builds/VSCode-linux-x64`, or set
  `HYPERVISOR_CODE_EDITOR_VSCODE_PACKAGED_ROOT`.
- Optional VS Code source checkout at `packages/hypervisor-adapter-targets/vscode`
  for adapter development.

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the Hypervisor App shell in development.
npm run dev:hypervisor-app

# Run the packaged code editor adapter host when testing editor targets.
npm run dev:hypervisor-code-editor-adapter-host

# Build the Hypervisor Workbench package
npm run build:workbench
```

`npm run dev:hypervisor-app` starts the Hypervisor App workspace client.
`npm run dev:hypervisor-code-editor-adapter-host` launches the packaged
Electron/VS Code code editor adapter host through
`scripts/launch-hypervisor-code-editor-adapter-host.mjs`. The adapter-host
launcher syncs only the current `hypervisor-vscode-extension` adapter into the
packaged host; it is not the Hypervisor product shell, does not start daemon
sidecars, does not mount models, and does not pass daemon tokens to the
extension. Set `HYPERVISOR_SKIP_EXTENSION_SYNC=1` to skip extension sync. The
`packages/hypervisor-adapter-targets/vscode` source checkout is optional for this
launch path; the required editor-host artifact is the packaged Electron app at
`packages/hypervisor-adapter-targets/builds/VSCode-linux-x64` or
`HYPERVISOR_CODE_EDITOR_VSCODE_PACKAGED_ROOT`. The old root `ide/` artifact path
is retired.

## Key Features

### Hypervisor Surfaces
- Sessions for live governed runs, approvals, blockers, receipts, and replay.
- Workbench for code/systems work through governed code-editor targets.
- Automations for workflow composition, templates, schedules, and reusable runs.
- Models for daemon-owned local model discovery, load, unload, route, server,
  log, receipt, and replay state.
- Terminal, browser, VM, HypervisorOS node, and cloud/provider operations live
  in Sessions and provider/environment views over the same daemon/Core
  contracts.
- Authority, Privacy, Foundry, and Receipts use the same daemon/Core contracts.

### Daemon-Owned Authority
- Hypervisor App and Workbench must not directly execute durable runtime work.
- Editor hosts, extension-host code, and webviews are projection/request surfaces.
- All consequential actions resolve through daemon/domain APIs.

### Validation
- `npm run dev:hypervisor-app` launches the Hypervisor App shell.
- `npm run dev:hypervisor-code-editor-adapter-host` launches the packaged
  editor adapter host when an editor target needs to be tested.
- GUI probes and goal scripts should target Hypervisor App surfaces and may use
  the packaged editor host as one code editor adapter target while retaining
  screenshots, logs, receipts, and proof JSON.
