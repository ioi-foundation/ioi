// Application UX Parity Baseline — matrix generator.
//
// The estate-wide parity program (phase doctrine: reference UX parity first, IOI substrate
// underneath, IOI-native UX later). This reads the canonical seed inventory + the capture-state
// starting-points artifact and emits a single per-seed PARITY MATRIX with an honest `parity_class`
// overlay — the program-level record of how far each application seed has travelled from "captured
// shell" to "daemon-bound IOI surface".
//
// parity_class taxonomy (honest, never a false "covered"):
//   reference_capture — the /__apps/<slug> reference baseline serves; NOT yet bound to daemon truth
//   daemon_bound      — an IOI-owned surface renders the reference grammar over REAL daemon truth
//   queued            — named as the next daemon-bound target (owner binding declared, not built)
// The captured boot state (boots_* / shell_only / blocked_missing_capture) is carried verbatim from
// the inventory as `capture_state` — it is NOT a parity claim, only what the local capture does.
//
// Deliberately data-driven: no per-seed truth is invented here; the overlay is a small explicit map.
// Usage: node apps/hypervisor/scripts/build-app-parity-matrix.mjs [--check]
//   --check → exit 1 if the committed matrix is stale (for CI / the verifier).
